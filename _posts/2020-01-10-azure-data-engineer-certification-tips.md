Recently I passed exams related to a such certification. And since then there is a flow of related but often-repeated questions. Over a time, they are crystalized into a post in Q/A format, which hopefully can be helpful for someone who wants to pass this Microsoft certification.

### What can I expect on exams?

The Data Engineer certification, in a contrast to SQL Server related exams, is less technical and more about understanding concepts of various services, their weak and strong sides and at what circumstances and requirements those services can be applied.

Because of signed NDA, I cannot disclose real questions, also I do not remember the most of them anymore. üòä

However, as I mentioned before, the main subject of exams is to ensure that you understand services and understand how they must be used, so you perhaps will have to clearly distinguish what is the difference in:

 -	Various Databricks node types and tiers
 -	Cosmos DB storage engines 
 -	Azure Streaming Analytics windowing functions
 -	etc etc

I suggest to watch two related MS Ignite sessions, luckily recordings are still available:

 - [Exam Prep DP-200: Implementing an Azure Data Solution](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/82936?source=sessions){:target="_blank"}

 - [Exam Prep DP-201: Designing an Azure Data Solution](https://myignite.techcommunity.microsoft.com/sessions/80164?source=sessions){:target="_blank"}

The session are led by Microsoft Certified Trainers (MCT), experienced in delivering a content on these topics.

### What training materials have you used?

Unfortunately, there is no self-training guide in a form of book available yet for any of the exams. 

As an alternative, Microsoft offers a set of free online courses on their new learning platform: [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn){:target="_blank"} which consists of modules:

 -	Azure for the Data Engineer
 -	Store data in Azure
 -	Work with relational data in Azure
 -	Work with NoSQL data in Azure Cosmos DB
 -	Large-Scale Data Processing with Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2
 -	Implement a Data Streaming Solution with Azure Streaming Analytics
 -	Implement a Data Warehouse with Azure SQL Data Warehouse
 -	Perform data engineering with Azure Databricks
 -	Extract knowledge and insights from your data with Azure Databricks

The learning roadmap has another more visual appearance: [Learning path for Azure Data Engineer](https://query.prod.cms.rt.microsoft.com/cms/api/am/binary/RWuAzL){:target="_blank"}

An example of the online content:

The completion of the roadmap takes around 40-60 hours. It pays off, because this set of modules covers nearly all subjects touched by exams. 
These free online courses were also my main training material.

Worth to mention a free to join Microsoft program: [Visual Studio Dev Essentials](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/dev-essentials/){:target="_blank"}. It unlocks an temporary access to free azure services and training resources like a **Pluralsight** and **LinkedIn Learning**, which can also be helpful during the training phase.

And of course, there is also an option of paid instructor-led courses via the network of learning partners:
 -	Course DP-200T01-A: Implementing an Azure Data Solution 
 -	Course DP-201T01-A: Designing an Azure Data Solution

### Was it an ‚Äúeasy to get‚Äù certification?

This answer is going to be very subjective, but I have to say ‚Äì *‚ÄúNo, the two required exams are not a something that you can go and pass blindly, without a preparation‚Äù*. Unless you work with all involved technologies and Azure services during during the last couple years 40 hours per week and already become a master in all of them.

Just to recall, 700 is a passing score. After months of training I was attending exams full of confidence. To my surprise, I received 712 points on a first exam. The second one I passed with not that much better score. Of course, I was glad to receive a congratulations message on a Prometric screen, but the failure was a close call.



### Final words

I hope that answers on those three questions and the referenced content gives an understanding about the certification and will help to prepare for exams and pass them from a first try.

Many thanks for reading.
